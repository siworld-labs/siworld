//! Research-only reference model for confidential fee settlement.
//!
//! This module models the fee-opening checks that a future native block-level
//! settlement AIR must enforce. It is deliberately outside the node and
//! consensus crates: callers must not use it to credit a miner or mutate
//! state. The model is useful for sizing, test vectors, and rejection tests
//! while the settlement AIR and the wallet-to-miner witness channel remain
//! under design.

/// The private fee opening carried by a wallet/mempool witness.
///
/// `dummy` and `priority` are witness flags. A dummy opening must have zero
/// fee and a real opening must have either the standard or priority fee. The
/// flags are intentionally not part of the public commitment statement; the
/// settlement relation checks them against the opening's fee.
