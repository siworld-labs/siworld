# Security and Privacy Model

The [monetary revision](v1-economics.md) adds review boundaries for trusted
snapshot-height locks, mode-dependent SIP reward notes, pool/burn conservation,
per-credit fund vesting and atomic economic rollback. Old profile results do
not qualify those changed relations. Wallet threshold backup reconstructs one
key and supplies no V1 consensus multisignature guarantee.

## Status and scope

**Engineering target ≥80-bit quantum security, pending independent review.**
The transaction, fixed-576 settlement and three-initial-note issuance relations
have a [source-bound engineering freeze](native-proof-profiles.md); they execute
in isolated proof tools. This does not adopt issuance policy or qualify other
capacity keys. Native
node, wallet, transport, retention and checkpoint integration remain
incomplete. There is no public native V1 testnet, production release or mainnet.
CI and estimator results do not establish independent approval.
[Dependency advisory applicability](dependency-advisories.md) distinguishes
runtime remediation from open isolated-experiment advisories.

The existing runnable node and retained seven-node N=2 engineering testnet
use the [legacy recursive classical route](legacy/security-model.md). Its keys,
history, two-output format and 100-block reorganization bound do not activate
native V1. Development mock proofs are forgeable and provide no proof security.

## Observer boundaries

| Observer | Available information |
| --- | --- |
| Chain reader | Headers/PoW, inclusion positions, nullifiers, commitments, ciphertexts, public issuance and fund records |
| Sidecar recipient | Relayed statement, arrival context and fee opening; a zero opening can identify padding to that recipient |
| Producer | Selected transactions, private fee openings and its own generated padding |
| Recipient wallet | Recovered note plaintexts and inclusion of its own payments |
| Transport peer | Its direct connection endpoints and traffic metadata |
| Privileged local process | Files and memory accessible to its OS identity, potentially including active secrets |

Uniform transaction shape and fee commitments reduce specified on-chain
signals. They do not guarantee perfect indistinguishability, payment-time
anonymity or source anonymity. Low traffic, known payments, active probing,
producer-owned padding and off-chain observations can weaken privacy. Public
metrics must not classify transactions/padding or emit individual fee openings,
endpoint identifiers or nullifier/time associations.

## Proof and encryption boundaries

The D8/W24/12 suite must pass actual-instance security accounting for every
native relation. Conjectured classical security must be ≥128 bits; selected
Johnson Fiat–Shamir, challenge-domain and BHT terms must meet the quantum
80-bit floors under their stated models. The measured 81.692-bit transaction
challenge ledger is not full-system security approval. Review transcript
binding, hiding randomness, dependency patches, application hashes and
composition independently. See [cryptography](cryptography.md) and
[collision accounting](bht-security-accounting.md).

The AIR binds ciphertext bytes but does not prove correct encryption or
decryptability. Sender self-checks, recipient AEAD/commitment validation and
protected receipt material remain wallet obligations. A malformed output may
lose that payment without violating the proof relation. ML-KEM note encryption
and ML-DSA signatures alone do not secure all protocol components.

Nullifier derivation is part of the proof relation. Global duplicate/spent
rejection is a node/state responsibility. Canonical encoding, trusted snapshot
resolution, duplicate statement-ID rejection and atomic application cannot be
replaced by a passing standalone proof.

## Network, storage and recovery

Hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM, dual-identity authentication and Dandelion++ are
selected native designs awaiting implementation and adversarial review.
Encrypted transport protects contents against recording attacks; endpoints
remain visible to peers. The existing legacy node uses Noise and direct flood
relay. Worker-handshake tests do not qualify native hybrid peer transport.

Native V1 requires a local 24-block reorganization bound, the newest 4,096
canonical snapshots and fail-closed recovery beyond the supported boundary.
Three-day-after-finality proof deletion makes full proof replay from genesis
unavailable by default. Release checkpoint bootstrap explicitly trusts a
genesis-pinned two-of-three authority; PoW does not prove deleted historical
validity. Permanent public-data integrity and backups remain mandatory.

Encrypted keystores, explicit unlock and zeroized owned buffers reduce specific
exposure paths. They do not prove erasure of allocator/compiler copies, swap,
crash dumps or dependency buffers. Monitoring services must not hold spend
keys. A compromised host can expose active keys and private fee openings.

## Activation gates

Complete the shared atomic transition, bounded decoders and isolated verifier
budgets, native wallet/recovery, actual-listener transport/source relay,
public-data durability, checkpoint authentication and real retention lifecycle.
Qualify validator and miner resources separately under maximum sustained load
and independent-host failures. Hardware profiles and modeled bandwidth are
not accepted operational guarantees. Close security-limiting findings through
independent review before public testnet launch; production requires further
explicit acceptance. See [testnet gates](prover-acceptance.md) and
[open requirements](11-risks-open-questions.md).
